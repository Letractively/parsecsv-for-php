=== parseCSV 0.3.1 ===
*_Date: 1-Sep-2007_*
  * Small change to default output settings to conform with RFC 4180 (http://rfc.net/rfc4180.html). Only the LF (line feed) character was used by default to separate rows, rather than CRLF (carriage return & line feed).

=== parseCSV 0.3.0 ===
*_Date: 9-Aug-2007_*
  * Changed to the MIT license.
  * Added offset and limit options.
  * Added SQL-like conditions for quickly filtering out entries. Documentation on the condition syntax is forthcoming.
  * Small parsing modification to comply with some recent changes to the specifications outlined on Wikipedia's Comma-separated values article.
  * Minor changes and optimizations, and a few spelling corrections. Oops :)
  * Included more complex code examples in the parseCSV download.

=== parseCSV 0.2.1 ===
*_Date: 8-Aug-2007_*
  * Fixed stupid code which caused auto function to not work in some situations.

=== parseCSV 0.2.0 beta ===
*_Date: 2-Jan-2007_*
  * Added auto() function to automatically detect delimiter character. Useful for user upload incase delimiter is comma (,), tab, or semi-colon (;). Some versions of MS Excel for Windows use semi-colons instead of commas when saving to CSV files. It uses a process of elimination to eliminate characters that can not be the delimiter, so it should work on all CSV-structured files almost no matter what the delimiter is.
  * Generally updated some of the core workings to increase performance, and offer better support for large (1MB and up) files.
  * Added code examples to header comment.
